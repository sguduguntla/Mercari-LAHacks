# Mercari

# Inspiration

As high–schoolers, we haven't had the opportunity to work with many companies or startups; however, with Mercari we are trying to connect people with ideas to those that can create the idea in exchange for equity in the company. Instead of working for no salary, anyone can bid on projects; if the seller – the person with the idea – agrees, they exchange contact information and can work together. Built at Los Altos Hacks 2016 with Jai Sankar, Varun Shenoy, and Anirudh Pai.
